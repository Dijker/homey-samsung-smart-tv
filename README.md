# Samsung Smart TV for Homey

Control your Samsung Smart TV via your Homey.

After adding your TV to your devices, you will get flow cards for:
* Changing the active source
* Set your TV to a different channel
* Power off
* Change volume / mute

There's much more possible, but I only included the most used actions. If you miss anything, feel free to open an issue or [contact me](#contact-me) directly.

**Note: At the moment ONLY the F series is 'officially' supported**

My intentions are to make the app available to as many people as possible.
